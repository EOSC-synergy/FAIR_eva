# Contributing
The current repository has been set to provide a public channel for the
interested communities to send contributions. The intended audience are
primarily, but not restricted to, stakeholders involved as FAIR data
producers, repository or data services managers and providers for research.

Contributions are in form of issues. These can be accompanied by an associated
change, done through a pull request. There are thematic issues for each type of
expected contribution:

* Typo report
* Inconsistency report
* Enhancement request
* Consultancy service

Please check first whether your fix/suggestion/enhancement/question fits in the
list of open issues. If so, add your contribution there. Otherwise, according
to your feedback, make use of any of the templates above or open a regular
issue for any other request.

Once your contribution has been successfully merged, your authorship will be
acknowledged in the [author list](content/metadata.yaml).
