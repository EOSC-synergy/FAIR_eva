Quality lies in the eye of the beholder; and there is no objective, ideal definition of it. Some datasets will be judged as low-quality resources by some data consumers, while they will perfectly fit others' needs. There are heuristics designed to fit specific assessment situations that rely on quality indicators, such as pieces of data content, pieces of data meta-information and human ratings, to give indications about the suitability of data for some intended use. DQV re-uses the notions of quality dimensions, categories and metrics to represent various approaches to data quality assessments. It also stresses the importance of allowing different actors to assess the quality of datasets and publish their annotations, certificates, or mere opinions about a dataset.", "linked_records": [], "linking_records": [], "fairsharing_registry": "Standard", "record_type": "model_and_format", "subjects": ["Data Quality"], "domains": ["Data retrieval"], "taxonomies": [], "user_defined_tags": ["Metadata standardization"], "countries": ["Worldwide"], "publications": [], "licence_links": [{"licence_name": "W3C Document License", "licence_id": 848, "licence_url": "https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Legal/2015/doc-license", "link_id": 1325, "relation": "undefined"}], "grants": [{"id": 6221, "fairsharing_record_id": 824, "organisation_id": 3201, "relation": "maintains", "created_at": "2021-09-30T09:27:53.136Z", "updated_at": "2021-09-30T09:27:53.136Z", "grant_id": null, "is_lead": false, "saved_state": {"id": 3201, "name": "W3C - Data on the Web Best Practices Working Group", "types": ["Consortium"], "is_lead": false, "relation": "maintains"}}, {"id": 6220, "fairsharing_record_id": 824, "organisation_id": 1567, "relation": "maintains", "created_at": "2021-09-30T09:27:53.104Z", "updated_at": "2021-09-30T09:27:53.104Z", "grant_id": null, "is_lead": false, "saved_state": {"id": 1567, "name": "Italian National Research Council (CNR) - Institute for Applied Mathematics and Information Technologies Enrico Magenes", "types": ["Research institute"], "is_lead": false, "relation": "maintains"}}, {"id": 9159, "fairsharing_record_id": 824, "organisation_id": 3197, "relation": "maintains", "created_at": "2022-04-11T12:07:18.374Z", "updated_at": "2022-04-11T12:07:18.374Z", "grant_id": null, "is_lead": false, "saved_state": {"id": 3197, "name": "Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, The Netherlands", "types": ["University"], "is_lead": false, "relation": "maintains"}}], "url_for_logo": null, "exhaustive_licences": false}}, {"id": "829", "type": "fairsharing_records", "attributes": {"created_at": "2018-10-19T22:07:18.000Z", "updated_at": "2022-02-08T10:50:51.072Z", "metadata": {"doi": "10.25504/FAIRsharing.22bb25", "name": "Generic Statistical Information Model Specification", "status": "ready", "contacts": [], "homepage": "https://statswiki.unece.org/display/gsim/GSIM+Specification", "citations": [], "identifier": 829, "description": "The GSIM Specification provides a set of standardized, consistently described information objects, which are the inputs and outputs in the design and production of statistics.

For the purpose of this specification, provenance is defined as a record that describes the people, institutions, entities, and activities involved in producing, influencing, or delivering a piece of data or a thing. In particular, the provenance of information is crucial in deciding whether information is to be trusted, how it should be integrated with other diverse information sources, and how to give credit to its originators when reusing it. In an open and inclusive environment such as the Web, where users find information that is often contradictory or questionable, provenance can help those users to make trust judgements.", "linked_records": [], "linking_records": [], "fairsharing_registry": "Standard", "record_type": "model_and_format", "subjects": ["Data Management", "Subject Agnostic"], "domains": ["Resource metadata"], "taxonomies": ["Not applicable"], "user_defined_tags": ["Metadata standardization"], "countries": ["United Kingdom", "United States"], "publications": [], "licence_links": [{"licence_name": "W3C Document License", "licence_id": 848, "licence_url": "https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Legal/2015/doc-license", "link_id": 1855, "relation": "undefined"}], "grants": [{"id": 7267, "fairsharing_record_id": 1344, "organisation_id": 3205, "relation": "maintains", "created_at": "2021-09-30T09:28:31.884Z", "updated_at": "2021-09-30T09:28:31.884Z", "grant_id": null, "is_lead": false, "saved_state": {"id": 3205, "name": "W3C Provenance Working Group", "types": ["Consortium"], "is_lead": false, "relation": "maintains"}}, {"id": 7266, "fairsharing_record_id": 1344, "organisation_id": 3122, "relation": "maintains", "created_at": "2021-09-30T09:28:31.850Z", "updated_at": "2021-09-30T09:28:31.850Z", "grant_id": null, "is_lead": false, "saved_state": {"id": 3122, "name": "University of Southampton, UK", "types": ["University"], "is_lead": false, "relation": "maintains"}}], "url_for_logo": null, "exhaustive_licences": false}}, {"id": "1356", "type": "fairsharing_records", "attributes": {"created_at": "2015-07-03T10:03:40.000Z", "updated_at": "2022-07-20T12:28:42.786Z", "metadata": {"doi": "10.25504/FAIRsharing.576wb", "name": "Common Metadata Elements for Cataloging Biomedical Datasets", "status": "ready", "contacts": [{"contact_name": "Kevin Read", "contact_email": "kevin.read@med.nyu.edu", "contact_orcid": "0000-0002-7511-9036"}], "homepage": "http://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.1496573", "identifier": 1356, "description": "The Common Metadata Elements for Cataloging Biomedical Datasets outlines a proposed set of core, minimal metadata elements that can be used to describe biomedical datasets, such as those resulting from research funded by the National Institutes of Health.

MITI uses structured metadata quality control and format relevant data levels to specify the extent of data processing, and in the case of sequencing data, whether access requires the approval of a data access committee. In common practice, data at levels 3 and up are freely shared. Primary data arising from microscopes and data acquisition instruments correspond to level 1 data. Because the raw image data acquired from one slide usually consist of separate image fields, possibly from proprietary formats, they are processed to correct for uneven illumination and other instrumentation artifacts and assembled into a single multichannel image in the OME-TIFF format (level 2 data).\n", "linked_records": [], "linking_records": [], "fairsharing_registry": "Standard", "record_type": "reporting_guideline", "subjects": ["Data Governance", "Biomedical Science", "Digital Image Processing"], "domains": ["Bioimaging", "Microscopy", "Imaging"], "taxonomies": ["All"], "user_defined_tags": ["Data standards", "image processing", "Metadata standardization"], "countries": ["Worldwide"], "publications": [{"id": 3257, "pubmed_id": 35277708, "title": "MITI minimum information guidelines for highly multiplexed tissue images", "year": 2022, "url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41592-022-01415-4", "authors": "Schapiro, Denis; Yapp, Clarence; Sokolov, Artem; Reynolds, Sheila M.; Chen, Yu-An; Sudar, Damir; Xie, Yubin; Muhlich, Jeremy; Arias-Camison, Raquel; Arena, Sarah; Taylor, Adam J.; Nikolov, Milen; Tyler, Madison; Lin, Jia-Ren; Burlingame, Erik A.; Abravanel, Daniel L.; Achilefu, Samuel; Ademuyiwa, Foluso O.; Adey, Andrew C.; Aft, Rebecca; Ahn, Khung Jun; Alikarami, Fatemeh; Alon, Shahar; Ashenberg, Orr; Baker, Ethan; Baker, Gregory J.; Bandyopadhyay, Shovik; Bayguinov, Peter; Beane, Jennifer; Becker, Winston; Bernt, Kathrin; Betts, Courtney B.; Bletz, Julie; Blosser, Tim; Boire, Adrienne; Boland, Genevieve M.; Boyden, Edward S.; Bucher, Elmar; Bueno, Raphael; Cai, Qiuyin; Cambuli, Francesco; Campbell, Joshua; Cao, Song; Caravan, Wagma; Chalign\u00e9, Ronan; Chan, Joseph M.; Chasnoff, Sara; Chatterjee, Deyali; Chen, Alyce A.; Chen, Changya; Chen, Chia-hui; Chen, Bob; Chen, Feng; Chen, Siqi; Chheda, Milan G.; Chin, Koei; Cho, Hyeyoung; Chun, Jaeyoung; Cisneros, Luis; Coffey, Robert J.; Cohen, Ofir; Colditz, Graham A.; Cole, Kristina A.; Collins, Natalie; Cotter, Daniel; Coussens, Lisa M.; Coy, Shannon; Creason, Allison L.; Cui, Yi; Zhou, Daniel Cui; Curtis, Christina; Davies, Sherri R.; Bruijn, Inode; Delorey, Toni M.; Demir, Emek; Denardo, David; Diep, Dinh; Ding, Li; DiPersio, John; Dubinett, Steven M.; Eberlein, Timothy J.; Eddy, James A.; Esplin, Edward D.; Factor, Rachel E.; Fatahalian, Kayvon; Feiler, Heidi S.; Fernandez, Jose; Fields, Andrew; Fields, Ryan C.; Fitzpatrick, James A.
